# Email Spam Detection System

A machine learning-based system that classifies emails as spam or legitimate (ham) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Support Vector Classification (SVC).

## üìä Dataset Analysis

The dataset contains email messages labeled as spam or ham. Here are key insights from our analysis:

- **Dataset Size**: 5,572 messages (before cleaning)
- **Distribution**:
  - Ham (legitimate): 87.4%
  - Spam: 12.6%

### Email Characteristics

- **Average Length**:

  - Spam Emails: ~138 characters
  - Ham Emails: ~70 characters

- **Word Count**:

  - Spam Emails: ~28 words on average
  - Ham Emails: ~17 words on average

- **Sentence Structure**:
  - Spam Emails: ~3 sentences on average
  - Ham Emails: ~2 sentences on average

### Most Common Words

**In Spam Emails:**

1. call (321 occurrences)
2. free (191 occurrences)
3. txt (141 occurrences)
4. text (122 occurrences)
5. mobile (114 occurrences)

**In Ham Emails:**

1. u (904 occurrences)
2. go (404 occurrences)
3. get (352 occurrences)
4. come (275 occurrences)
5. ok (251 occurrences)

## üõ† Technical Implementation

### Preprocessing Steps

1. Text lowercase conversion
2. Tokenization using NLTK
3. Special character removal
4. Stop word and punctuation removal
5. Word stemming using Porter Stemmer

### Model Comparison

We tested three different classifiers:

1. **Support Vector Classification (SVC)**

   - Accuracy: 98%
   - Precision: 100%
   - Confusion Matrix:
     ```
     [[889   0]
      [ 25 120]]
     ```

2. **Random Forest Classifier**

   - Accuracy: 98%
   - Precision: 99.19%
   - Confusion Matrix:
     ```
     [[888   1]
      [ 23 122]]
     ```

3. **Naive Bayes Classifier**
   - Accuracy: 97%
   - Precision: 99.17%
   - Confusion Matrix:
     ```
     [[888   1]
      [ 25 120]]
     ```

Based on these results, **SVC** was chosen as the final model due to its highest precision score and better handling of false positives.
